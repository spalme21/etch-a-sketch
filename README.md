# etch-a-sketch

This a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

It allows you to use your mouse pointer to draw in the browser window. You can clear the window, as well as change the resolution.

This project primarily demonstrates my JavaScript ability, as well as some CSS Flexbox, and basic HTML and CSS.
